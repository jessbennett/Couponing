        <h3 className="textHeader">Why choose us?</h3>
        <p className="text">If you are a consumer you can find new and interesting events or foods that you may have never knew existed otherwise. As a consumer you can use Couponer to save money on activities that you would have done regardless, it pays for itself! If you are a buisness owner you can use Couponer to advertise your buisness and make money at the same time, other coupon websites take a large percentage of each sale. We believe that is not only anti-entrepreneur, but these aggressive margins can often times drive away up and coming small businesses.</p>
